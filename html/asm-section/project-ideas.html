      <h1>Project Ideas</h1>
      <p>
        Our project will be a web game name Bouncing Ball based on the Ping Pong
        Game [1] which is Minh’s idea. The game will have a ball and a bar, each
        time the ball bounces, the player gets one score, after a certain amount
        of time or the ball hits the bottom, the total score will be awarded.
        There will be some development within the project depending on the skill
        sets of each team member, adding a leaderboard for friends to compete
        for fun, random obstacles for the ball to hit, sound animation, maybe a
        Christmas theme and much more. This project's aim is to help people
        relax after a tough day by looking at the bouncing ball and getting a
        score.

          "The project idea was sparked and developed by Minh himself. The first
          game concept is quite basic and easy to interact with yet somehow, it
          is still very interesting and fun to spend your leisure time on for a
          few rounds. Hence, it will be the kind of game that is both relaxing
          and entertaining to play! However, the background theme is a bit hard
          to separate itself from the interactive objects. Furthermore, the game
          had started on its own before I could read any instructions, so it was
          a bit confusing at first. I recommend we have a start button, a pause
          button, a continue button and some warning signs when the levels get
          higher. Additionally, we can add more features to the game, such as
          boost-up potion for the bat; or to make it more challenging, we could
          add obstacles like random objects popping out, etc. Lastly, I suggest
          we have a little touch on both the designs of the layout and the
          interactive objects. Since the visuals, which will be what attract and
          keep the users around, are also important. One of the re-touches
          should be the background itself, we can change to something duller on
          the color, yet still keep the theme of Christmas; we should also give
          the players a variety choice of costumes for the balls and bats so
          that they can choose as they please. All in all, I personally believe
          that the project’s first completion is brilliant and with just a
          little more adjustment as I mentioned, opinions and contributions from
          the rest of the teammates, the game will stand out and might as well
          become more completed and unique on its own." - Doanh

          "Minh's suggestion came as the inspiration for our project's concept.
          Although the first game concept is basic and easy to play, I believe
          it has potential for further development. I simply wanted to provide
          some suggestions for our current project. First and foremost, I
          believe that we should customize our game by enabling players to
          choose their own themes using more bright graphics and colors. Next,
          we should make it multiplatform accessible, so that users can easily
          play it on a variety of various devices and platforms. Finally,
          organizing a competition with an attractive reward might stimulate
          people's interest in our game and make them more interested in it." -

          "Our project was based on Minh’s idea. Personally, I think Minh’s
          project is a clever project which can mitigate the competitiveness
          between the players. Though I think the project should have some
          different game modes such as most points scored during a specific time
          or a 2 versus 2 mode to have more attractiveness. In addition, we
          should add some bar skins to brings positive experience for the
          players. Furthermore, a weekly contest for a group of friends with a
          reward is worth to bring in consider. From my perspective, I think my
          ideas will help the project to improve its friendliness to enhance the
          user’s experience to the fullest." - Kiet
