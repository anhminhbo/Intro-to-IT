        <div id = "pr1"> We discussed about it and eventually decided on a new group name, rather than each person’s current group name. We arrive at the name MKDK. We believe this is the greatest and most equitable name for everyone since it is the first letters for each of our names.  </div>

                <div class = "perinfo">Everyone can call me Minh for short, I have worked as a developer before, so I have little experience in researching and coding. I used to do programming on the backend side which requires lots of knowledge, therefore, I have good problem solving and easy-to-learn new things. My hobbies are programming, playing games, and spending time with my family. Moreover, I am interested in backend development. Anyway, I have not thought about the team's name yet. But I may name it Never Give Up because it has been an exceptionally long journey since I started to switch my major into IT field, I have been through tough time to finally decide to study in IT, and never give up is the slogan I used to motivate myself. </div>

                <div class = "perinfo">I'm currently in Hoi An, my hometown, which is a rather secure place to be despite the pandemic. I'd like to increase my IT skills since I enjoy working with algorithms and data and applying what I've learnt. After graduating from high school in July, I discovered RMIT University is the perfect place to learn, grow, and make new friends. In my spare time, I enjoy reading novels or playing games to keep myself entertained. Between now and then, I intend to pursue a career in both cyber security and video game production. I only have a basic knowledge of IT, but I believe I could pick it up quickly, and I'm constantly trying to broaden my knowledge. </div>

                <div class = "perinfo">I was born and grew up in Ho Chi Minh city – Vietnam. During my study in high school, I took great interest in English and Math. One of my favorite things to do in my leisure time is drawing. I also enjoy learning new languages and playing video games. On top of all that, I am more interested in technology, and especially the coding field. I started to develop my interest for the field in the mid of high school and having been exposed to how technology worked, my passion for it continued to grow. Being an introvert and a very shy person, I am unconfident about myself, so i wanted to study in an international environment to build up what I am still lacking. Hence, I chose to study IT at RMIT University. I may not have any IT experience before, but I believe I will gain many academic and soft skills during my time here. </div>

                <div class = "perinfo">Incipiently, everyone can call me Ben for short and my nationality is Vietnamese. Currently I can express my words and communicate in English fluently. Additionally, I can comprehend some basic sentences of Spanish. I have a huge devotion with coding since I was in my secondary school. On top of that, I usually play badminton and basketball with my friends in my free time to mitigate the stress after a diligent period, as a rule I will have dinner with my family or playing online games such as League of Legends, Valorant. I have participated in some coding courses, especially the C++ and C# course, reading some IT books, discovering the Information Technology sector to crave for my desire. Hence, I will have to choose the next home port after I have graduated high school and RMIT University that is a quintessential environment for me to uncover the erudite work of the IT area. Hopefully I hope I will go through my university life effortlessly, make many good friends, and get myself equipped with many useful knowledge of IT that I could serve for my dream job in the long run. </div>

                <div class = "perinfo">In addition to the results themselves, these tests do show me my strengths and my own weaknesses. Some questions were hard to answer but they helped me to think about a general image of myself. Thus, I can acknowledge what aspects I am still lack at and better them. I used to take the Myers-Briggs test in the past, and the result stayed the same, which also means my view on myself stayed unchanged. However, I personally think that all of the tests never fully reflect all of oneself. The tests only judge and show the results based on our answers, so the opinions from people surrounding us will reveal new things about ourselves that we have yet to discover.<br>As a teammate, these results would not influence my behavior in a bad way. I will engage colleagues and teammates in creative pursuits and promote my ideas in a teamwork. These results make me become more confident in my ideas and solutions when it comes to teamwork problems. Working in a team means we ought to cover each other’s weak spots. There one of the test says that my weakness is perfectionism which is the number one enemy to teamwork. Hence, I should keep a positive mind and listen to my peers’ perspectives. Thus, I could be suitable for the touch-up part in the report and customizing our website. </div>
