          Blockchain is a distributed database which is shared among computer networks. It stores electronic information in digital form. Moreover, blockchain is an innovation which secure and validate data itself and do not depend on any organizations, which is why it is the technology that people lean on to secure personal data as well as validate their existed data to others, the data is always transparent in this case. This technology has already been implemented in industry and will soon dominate in 5 years' time. Lastly, blockchain is built on 4 main concepts: [3]<br>
        </div>

        <ul style = "list-style-type: disc", id = "content">
          <li>Distributed ledger: everyone can have access to it within the computer networks.</li>
          <li>Cryptographic: based on crypto functions to ensure the integrity and security of the information.</li>
          <li>Personalize: each participant confirms the changes with others, no need of third-party organization for validation.</li>
          <li>Can run additional business logic: developers can implement more business requirements based on various aspects, for example: smart contract with transaction or asset embedded into blockchain.</li>
        </ul>
        <div id = "Content">
          Blockchain holds data in a block, a chain of blocks is considered to hold larger amount of data corresponding to the users. Each block concludes some important attributes, previous block Hash, current data, timestamp, current block Hash. Current block Hash is the cryptography to encrypted data, in this case is the combination of data, timestamp and previous hash. Therefore, the hash will link block into a unbreakable chains, if hackers try to get access to one block, they must know the key to decrypt the block and also need to change other block as well (because they are linked, if one block is fake, the other block hash will show that one block is getting modified) and the owner will know as soon as possible, because everybody has access to it, therefore hackers will get exposed.
        </div>
        <div id = "content">
          Each participant inside blockchain will then decrypted the block to investigate the data inside and validate it using the cryptography function behind, and then boomed, the blockchain process completed, a block is added to the chain, and holds history of transaction between users.
        </div>
        <div id = "content">
          In a result, blockchain is considered a technology for individual action which is proof to others that the data is transparent and secure enough to be entrusted.
        </div>
        <div id = "content">
          Blockchain innovation will impact any industry which requires heavy security. For example: bank, finance, real estate, supply chain. [2]
        </div>
        <div id = "content">
          For banks and finance, people can feel secure where they put money into the bank because of high security and transparency. Real estate can hold transactions of each user of the land to make it obvious and the process will be much faster because the data is correct which does not need any organization to verify. Supply chain can prove its products original as well as its quality through blockchain that helps consumer feel secure and pleased to buy the product.
        </div>
        <div id = "content">
          With this modern technology and rise of cryptocurrency, the government can get discharged because they will no longer control the transparent of transaction anymore. For example, in real estate, each person wants to buy the land need to contact higher authority, which is the government for their land occupation and transaction, with the help of blockchain, the data is secured enough for individual to process next step in the transaction themselves.
        </div>
        <div id = "content">
          In our daily life, blockchain will help us wake up in the morning feeling secure that our digital bank account or any important asset online will be secured and transparent. We will not need to scare of scram news that different bank authorities got hacked. We can worry less about our parents fearing losing money or any asset which information kept online, or even buy healthy food or not, because the food data is kept in blockchain that we already know their original and time of production, etc.
