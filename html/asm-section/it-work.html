    <dl>
        <dt>1.	Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do? </dt>
        <dd>“My job title is a business system analyst, so the company I'm working for is like a corporation. It’s different to a normal company where all the clients are members, so corporation - which works by members only. So, the system itself that I'm supporting or providing is an insurance system. Basically, my role would overlook at the improvement of the system, any troubleshooting of any problem, releasing new functions and help business to do testing of new systems or new functionality. That’s the core of it.”</dd>
        <dt>2.  Please tell us about the industry you work in. </dt>
        <dd>“The company-like-mentioned is a cooperation. It’s called Capricorn Society and what it does is providing a finance system relating to automobile industry, members will be able to buy through selected supplier. And the account would be built through Capricorn and all the account is managed through Capricorn. Also, they can do insurance which is buying covering protections for their businesses or personal properties.”</dd>
        <dt>3.	What other kinds of work do you have to do? </dt>
        <dd>“The system itself is a third-party software and it's basically an insurance, so obviously, the Members basically would have, for example, an automobile repair workshop and they would need a protection to cover their buildings or their workmanship or the equipment, so what we cover is the protection for them and they basically get a quote and that would give them protection if anything happened. So, from insurance point of view, you manage their cover and then if there's any accident, you would cover the claim so they would raise a claim for an incident, and you'll basically process and pay them off and basically go through and that's what the whole business is. So, the system itself helps that process in managing or collecting the premium for the protection and then also does the claim processing. So basically, if they claim and there is a repair required so we would arrange for repairers, make the payment to the repairers, or make the payments to Members and then complete the work. So, for the nature of the work, my role is basically supporting that system, so I mean I don't have to use the system, but there will be occasionally problem or the user is not familiar with certain functionality, then they would contact me for advice. And also, sometimes we have got new features introduced so my role would be also to manage that deployment of the new functions or vice versa if the business requires new functionality, we would ask the vendor to incorporate that new basically getting a quote, as in how much it will cost; give them to specific requirements; and manage to testing and the roll out of the new functionality. So that's really the core of it.”</dd>
        <dt>4.	Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them.</dt>
        <dd>“OK, so my claim or my customer mainly are the employee within the company. So, it will be the people in the claim department or the people in the customer services that use the system itself so the end users, but they are within the company and so I deal with them mainly. Then obviously we would deal with external vendor - that's the company that I look after the software. So those are the two main areas or customers that I support on a day-to-day basis and obviously with the internal IT so we pretty much have an in-house IT group. So, in some company you're aware that there is an outsource certain functionality where in our organization we have it all in house. So, the only thing is the software vendor itself, so any particular software enhancement to the system will be done through this particular company, but otherwise, infrastructure support would be within the company.”</dd>
        <dt>5.	Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.  </dt>
        <dd>“OK, so in terms of interaction with other IT so we got an IT department so that they’re mainly providing a first level support for all issues or incident lock. So, for example a customer will log up in and if they couldn't even access the system. So that's a first level. So that's someone else deal with it, that's an IT service desk group. And if there's any errors or problems specifically to the insurance system then they will escalate to myself. So, we call ourselves a second or third level support and then, well, part of my role is basically investigating what is the problem so it could sometime come down to a hardware problem. It's more a network or infrastructure problem, so there would be in IT infrastructure side which I could escalate to if it's a software issues then it's either I can resolve it. If it's not, then, again escalated to the vendor who does the software. If it's a software bug, that's when I would escalate to the external. So, the developer themselves is an external. So, because the system itself is owned by a third company, so all development and bug fixes are done by them, so that's where I would interact with them in that way.”</dd>
        <dt>6.	What about your interactions with clients or investors? </dt>
        <dd>“OK, so because our Capricorn have got different divisions, so the division, which is called at risk division, is basically looking after the insurance side, so they would be my main stakeholder. And there will be different managers, so there's a combination of the claim sections - the customer service and also the finance department within the Risk division so they would be potentially my customer that I deal with in regard to the system that I support.”</dd>
        <dt>How do you deal with them?</dt>
        <dd>“OK, yeah, so basically, as a day-to-day, I would have requests from the-end-users on how to use the system or troubleshoot any problem but we have an ongoing fortnightly support that basically to prioritize work requests like it could be a small box or it could be an enhancement. So basically, if you could understand, there's always new requests coming through and the vendor themselves have a capacity, I mean, limited resources that they can deal with, so it's not like you could request for five enhancements and they can do it all at once. So basically, they would just put through their requests and we will say: OK these are parity and it's driven by, I guess, the importance or also legislation, so we might have certain legislation or auditing requirements that come in that's of high priority. Then they need to take higher priority. So basically, we have an ongoing meeting with the different stakeholders for them to decide what needs to go in first. Obviously, everything is driven by the business themselves, so they know and they will basically request for certain type of work needs to go in through first and being the person who coordinate between the business and the IT or the vendor. I'm pretty much of a middle person to discuss with them.”</dd>
        <dt>7.	What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these. </dt>
        <dd>“Oh, well, so we recently just went through an upgrade. So basically, the software was an older version and we went through an upgrade, so part of the upgrade and that was a project that we set up. So basically, just test every functionality that come through from the business point of view because there's no system is bug free, so we just have to make sure that the way that we work for the system. So, we went through very extensive testing and working with business as well to make sure that all their current operations are supported by this new software. So that was the upgrade, so that's why ongoing project that took about four months for that to happen. But other than that, there will be a day today, so what we call is a business-as-usual, if you probably heard about BAU. So really, that's what my normal role is, to provide the business-as-usual support, which means that day-to-day operations or process improvement, if need to, but basically work with business to make sure that their everyday is working, provide additional reports or ad hoc and query for whatever reason that they need, but yeah.”</dd>
        <dt>8.	Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging? </dt>
        <dd>“Uh-huh, because being in this role, I don't need to do the technical side in terms of like the coding side so that the most challenging I guess or rewarding also is setting-in and expectation of the customer; or explaining them a new concept or new roles. So basically, when you deal with different Business or they have a different level of understanding of an IT, so I am able to talk to them in the level they understand and translate that into the system could be sometimes challenging. Because, for example, we deal with the accountant people, I think their brain works different to ours. So, it's basically trying to understand and come to a middle ground. That's probably the most challenging and rewarding as well in my role.”</dd>
        <dt>9.	Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry? </dt>
        <dd>“Well, I guess being a system analyst, so our role is to analyze and understand how the whole system works. Uh, so being able to work with the business and I guess the key point is to work collaboratively with them and you need to have a clear communication And, yeah. And I guess, well-organized, sometimes you always have requests coming through in all sorts of areas. So, I guess to be organized is quite important. So, time management and organization are also important in this sort of role.”</dd>

    <h2>After hearing the interviewee and her answers, our answers for the following questions:</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>1.	What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</dt>
        <dd>Besides the coding field, IT professionals can also be those who work on different tasks. Some companies will hire IT professionals to maintain their wide range of networks of computer systems, including testing, building, installing, repairing the hardware and software within the complex computer systems locally or remotely. Thus, IT professionals can be those who work directly with the coding, fixing bugs and maintaining the company computing networks; or the people who help with the business side, communicating, analyzing data, and testing. Moreover, there is other people who work in IT field but their main role are managers, which they know both IT and business issues that can help leverage company in scalable environment.</dd>
        <dt>2.	What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</dt>
        <dd>IT professionals can interact with either other people of the same profession, customers, clients or other company investors. Those people could be within the company or the software vendors or even end-users.</dd>
        <dt>3.	Where do the IT professionals spend most of their time?</dt>
        <dd>The time-spending depends on the task of which IT professionals has to do. In terms of working location, with the nature of the internet, it is easier nowadays to work-from-home while maintaining work notwithstanding. Hence, IT professionals can spend most of their time at their accommodations and work on their personal devices. On the other hand, some companies require them to interact with the host computer, so the IT professionals handling the tasks will then spend most of their time working at the company locations so that they can have exclusive access to the network or server.
            In terms of the working aspect, the IT professionals will spend most times on maintaining the network when there is a coming update, including testing and working with the business side, and the technical sides to assure the new updates work and adapt. Therefore, when there is a new upgrade, the ongoing projects that may take months for them to complete.
        </dd>
        <dt>4.	What aspect of their position is most challenging?</dt>
        <dd>Some professional IT will deal with the technical side of the work, which is the coding side. Some, on the other hand, deals with the business side of the work, which is to come into the middle round and explain the IT knowledge for both sides to understand and work with each other. Beside from interacting directly with the complex computing system itself, it is also challenging to get the people who have different level of understanding the IT field to cooperate. </dd>
